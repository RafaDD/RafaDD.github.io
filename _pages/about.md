<h2 style="margin-top: 3px">About me</h2>

I'm a junior undergraduate student at School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. My research interest includes machine learning, artificial intelligence and data mining. 

I'm advised by [Prof. Guanjie Zheng](https://jhc.sjtu.edu.cn/~gjzheng/) of CILAB from John Hopcroft Center for Computer Science, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. From July to September 2024, I worked as a student intern in [Prof. Xinyu Zhang](http://xyzhang.ucsd.edu/)'s laboratory.
