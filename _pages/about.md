I'm a junior undergraduate student from School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. My research interest includes machine learning, artificial intelligence and data mining.

I'm very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Zheng Guanjie](https://jhc.sjtu.edu.cn/~gjzheng/) of CILAB from John Hopcroft Center for Computer Science, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Before that, I was advised by [Prof. Jin Haiming](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~jinhaiming/) from Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University

You can find my personal CV here [Ding Jianrong's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
