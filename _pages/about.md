I'm a junior undergraduate student at School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. My research interest includes machine learning, artificial intelligence and data mining. I'm advised by [Prof. Zheng Guanjie](https://jhc.sjtu.edu.cn/~gjzheng/) of CILAB from John Hopcroft Center for Computer Science, Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

You can find my CV here [Ding Jianrong's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
