I'm a junior undergraduate student from School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. My research interest includes machine learning, artificial intelligence and data mining.

I'm very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Zheng Guanjie](https://jhc.sjtu.edu.cn/~gjzheng/) of CILAB from John Hopcroft Center for Computer Science, Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

You can find my personal CV here [Ding Jianrong's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
